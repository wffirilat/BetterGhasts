it's a minecraft mod!!

Please don't mess with files directly, but if you see something wrong (you probably will), you can clone the repo and fix it in a new branch. 

#### To Download:
This repo was meant to be installed on top of a fresh 1.7.10 recommended forge src. Since you can only clone to empty directories, you will have to clone it, extract the `forge-<version>-src.zip` after you clone and skip all conflicts. Then open a terminal in the directory and run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`. (`./gradlew` for OSX/Linux), then run `gradlew eclipse` or `gradlew idea` to set up your preferred IDE. It will have made a `com.example.examplemod` folder, you can and should delete it.
